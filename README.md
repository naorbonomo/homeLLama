## note this is a made up readme file!

HomeLlama is a Visual Studio Code extension that brings the power of local Large Language Models (LLMs) to your development environment. With HomeLlama, you can leverage AI assistance without relying on cloud-based services, ensuring privacy and offline functionality.

## Features

- **Local LLM Integration**: Run AI models directly on your machine for code completion, refactoring suggestions, and more.
- **Customizable Model Selection**: Choose from a variety of pre-trained models or use your own fine-tuned versions.
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Get intelligent code recommendations based on your current project and file context.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens locally, ensuring your code never leaves your machine.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code version 1.60.0 or higher
- At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended for larger models)
- 2GB of free disk space for model storage

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
